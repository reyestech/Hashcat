# CTF Category Description
### Challenge Description:
This challenge involves password cracking through hash analysis, a vital component of cybersecurity, particularly ethical hacking. Hash analysis requires comprehension and decryption of cryptographic hash functions, commonly used to store passwords securely. The challenge tests one's ability to reverse-engineer these hashes to retrieve the original password, an essential skill for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.


### Relation to Ethical Hacking Course:
This exercise highlights the practical skills necessary for cracking passwords, which are crucial for ethical hacking and cybersecurity defense strategies. Password cracking is not just about bypassing security but also about comprehending the significance of strong password policies and the consequences of weak passwords. These goals are in line with the objectives of the ethical hacking course, which aims to equip learners with the knowledge to test, improve, and enhance security systems.


### Lab Topic:
The laboratory concentrated on password security and cracking techniques, offering practical experience in ethical hacking methods. The lab addressed different approaches to password cracking, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and the utilization of advanced tools like Hashcat. Participants learned how to analyze various hash types, use wordlists efficiently, and apply practical solutions to improve password security in their systems.

# Background Knowledge Needed

### Hash Algorithms: </b>

Types of Hash Algorithms: </b>
Understanding different types of hash algorithms, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and NTLM is crucial. Each algorithm has unique characteristics and vulnerabilities that affect how it can be cracked.

Hash Function Behavior: </b>
Knowledge of how hash functions work, including converting input data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash code.


### Wordlists: 
1.	Precompiled Lists: Familiarity with widely used wordlists like rockyou.txt, which contain common passwords and phrases that can be used in dictionary attacks.
2.	Wordlist Management: Skills in managing and updating wordlists to ensure they remain relevant and comprehensive, incorporating new and emerging password trends.
3.	Hashcat: Installation and Setup: Proficiency in installing and configuring Hashcat in various environments, including virtual machines and cloud instances, including common commands, options, and flags used for different types of attacks.

### Cryptography Basics:
1.	Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption: Understanding the differences between these two main types of encryptions and their respective uses.
2.	Salting: Knowledge of how salts enhance security by adding randomness to hash functions and how to handle salted hashes during cracking attempts.
3.	Key Management: This section provides insights into best practices for key management and how weak critical practices can lead to vulnerabilities.
